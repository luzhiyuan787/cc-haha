/**
 * Keeps one transcript item that fails to render from taking the whole app with it.
 *
 * The root ErrorBoundary replaces everything, and a transcript is rebuilt from saved
 * history — so a single bad record (issue #1400: an AskUserQuestion input the model
 * got wrong) crashed the app again on every launch, because the open tab is restored.
 * Here the failure stays in its row: the rest of the conversation, the sidebar and the
 * composer keep working, and the error still goes to Diagnostics.
 *
 * There is deliberately no automatic retry. A stored record fails the same way every
 * time, and retrying on each render would report it on every update of a live list.
 * The row is tried again whenever it is mounted afresh (switching session, reloading).
