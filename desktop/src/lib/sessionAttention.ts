 * Whether a session is parked on a decision only the user can make: a tool

 * as `permission_request` and land in the same records that PermissionDialog,
 * AskUserQuestion and the composer render from, so a marker built on this can
 * never disagree with the card behind the tab.
 *
 * It reads the records, not `chatState`. `status(tool_executing)`,
 * `session_state(running)` and `content_start` overwrite `chatState` while the
 * request is still open, which switched a state-based marker off under a card
 * that was still waiting. Computer Use records are left out on purpose: nothing
 * renders them, so counting them would light a marker with no card to answer.
 *
 * This is the one place that decides. The tab strip, both sidebar views and the
 * mobile header all call it; a surface that grows its own rule will drift.
