/**
 * "Some sessions are waiting for you — take me to the next one."
 *
 * The mark on a tab says which tab; this says how many, and turns "find them
 * in a strip that scrolls" into one press. A person coming back to a run of
 * reviewers all stopped on the same kind of card can clear them one after
 * another without hunting for each.
 *
 * `count` is the waiting sessions other than the one on screen — the places a
 * press can actually go — and the caller only renders this when it is above
 * zero. The pill is a `Badge` so it borrows the warning container pair that
 * the contrast tests already cover, inside a real button that owns the focus
 * ring and the press. Static: the pulse is the tab mark's, and a second thing
 * breathing at the other end of the strip would only compete with it.
